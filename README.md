*This is the final course project for **CS 410 - Text Retrieval & Mining** course at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.*


The function of this tool is to scrape all the channel's an individual is subscribed to and acquire all kinds of promo codes, deals and discounts. People spend a lot of time on Youtube watching all kinds of different videos and it can be hard to keep track of all the promotions, giveaways or discounts that they come across. Our tool will help them to identify the videos from the channel's they are subscribed too that containt promotions, discounts or promo codes.

## System Requirements

  #install bs4
  pip install bs4

  #install selenium
  pip install selenium

## Behavior

Given the url for the channels a person is subscribed to our tool retrive:

- The lists of all the channels the person is subscribed to and the channel names
- The list of the last 30 videos posted for each channel as well as the list of all these video links
- The number of videos that were posted in the last month
- The description of each video that was posted in the last month
- Any deals that are found from the descriptions of these videos
